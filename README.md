# Welcome to Naomi T-T Levine's Website

I am a trained Anthropologist, critical scholar, and PhD Candidate in Organizational Communication at Purdue University in the Brian Lamb School of Communication. I am also a co-facilitator for an [Antiracist Reading Group](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~bradfoa/antiracist_reading_group/) in the Purdue Math Department and the founder of a [Writer's Workshop Group](organizational_relationships) at Purdue University.

Broadly, my [research](research) interests are physical infrastructure & materiality; diversity, equity, and inclusion; expressed organizational values; identification; and empathy. My current work has been focused on defining empathy for the purposes of making it actionable in research as a metatheoretical framework and [building a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rodHVoKKnOE) for describing what empathy could look like in different types of research. For more deatils see [Modeling Empathy](/empathy) and learn more about the current state of the model, plans for growing the model, and the latest comments schoalrs have shared with me about this model.  
  
Check out my page on [Methodologies, Data Management & Metatheoretical Approach(es)](methodologies) to learn more about the kind of work I've done, hope to do in the future, and the lens through which I view my role in research and field work.
