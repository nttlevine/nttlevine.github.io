Broadly, my [research](research) interests are physical & digital infrastructure; diversity, equity, and inclusion; expressed organizational values; identification; and empathy. Current work has been focused on defining empathy for the purposes of making it actionable in research as part of methodology and [building a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rodHVoKKnOE) for describing what empathy could look like in different types of research.
