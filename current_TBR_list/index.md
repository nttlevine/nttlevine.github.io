## Modeling Empathy

This is where my endeavors to model empathy as a metatheoretical approach to conducting research by humans with humans will live. I intend to update this page as I get input from conferences and emails from scholars with their suggestions. 

### The Model
![Empathy Model](v.4.png)

Great work in Communication Studies and the social sciences, more broadly, have used engaged methodologies like the relationally attentive approach (RAA; see Connaughton, Linabary, Krishna, Kuang, Anaele, Vibber, Yakova & Jones, 2017; Linabary, Krishna & Connaughton, 2017), participatory action research (PAR; see Gubrium & Harper, 2016; Gubrium, Harper & Otañez; 2016), and community-based participatory research (CBPR). While all of these methodologies are engaged, they each hold a different central part as a core tenet. RAA, for example, centers “with” and “relational” orientations. RAA also encourages “attentiveness” to relationship with whom we are collaborating and argues that the communicative choices we make (i.e., convening inclusively, deferring, supporting, validating) must be conscious choices if we are relationally attentive. With PAR, there is a centralized focus around the research producing “action”. What is missing is the power dynamic of things being defined relative to one another; the trouble comes when one thing is viewed as the dominant/majority over the other and the other is only defined relative to the dominant. I advance that centralizing the act of empathy in engaged scholarship is how best to subvert the assumed power dichotomy within research. This is how empathy came to be the core tenant of the proposed Community-based Empathetic Scholarship model. The model was created via a literature review of scholarship on empathy, RAA, and PAR which was followed with four phases of model iterative (de)construction performed from the vantage points of Critical Scholarship, Intersectional feminism, Black feminism, Chicana feminism, (dis)ability allyship and anti-colonialism. From this, I propose three dimensions of empathy as situated within three major processes of applied research and colored by the community-based practices of RAA, PAR, and CBPR. The dimensions of empathy are approaching knowing what another is feeling, simulating feeling what another is feeling, and communicating compassionately which are a modification of the dimensions of empathy proposed by Levenson and Ruef (1992). In the Community-based Empathetic Scholar model, each of these dimensions are discussed in terms of how they present within the overlapping—and, often, simultaneous—applied research processes of data collection, data analysis, and outcomes/action. Empathy in data collection could look like, but not be limited to, inviting difficult discourse, being mindful of the accessibility of the data to the community, and premeditating the afterlife of the relationship being forged while gathering the data. For data analysis, this model encourages scholars to simulate the experience of having this data existing about themselves and treating it with the same reverence that they would hold in their own efforts to save-face. Then, in considering the outcomes and/or programming, this model emphasizes negotiating the power designed into the research relationship in favor of the community by collaboratively working toward something co-constructed. Following the in-depth discussion of envisioned usages, this project implores scholars to heed one call to action: practice empathy.

Text description of the image of the model: Pictured is a diagram of the Community-based Empathetic Scholarship Model (version 4). There are layers of shapes and colors. The most prominent being a large light yellow circle which reads "Community-based". Contained within the large light yellow circle are three overlapping circles which read (clockwise) "Data Collection" as a light green circle, "Data Analysis" as a light purple circle, and "Outcomes/Programming" as a light orange circle. Contained within each of the overlapping circles are a light blue triangle, a light blue diamond, and a light blue pentagon. These represent the three dimensions of empathy as being within the three areas of applied research which are contained within community-based pedagogy. The triangle represents "approaching knowing what another is feeling". The diamond represents "simulating feeling what another is feeling". The pentagon represents "communicating compassionately"

How the model was designed: Early versions of this model were designed with consideration for my scientific model colleagues in mind. I wanted this to be a “plug-n-play” model that was fluid and informed by critical scholarship. This lead to an issue where the first model was not as flexibile as it needed to be based on the empathy literature and had the potential to have a colonizing and paternalistic afterlife. With this, I borrowed from the rhetoricians and critically examined the language as well as scholars of visual communication to look at the overall presentation of the model. This produced a model with clearer language and political influence, but it was messy and hard to use. Ultimately, I knew I was working toward making a model to describe a non-linear process with components that could both be repeated as well as done simultaneously to one another. For further assistance, I turned to my partner and colleague in Mathematics, Alden Bradford, for assistance. With his background in mathematical modeling and computer programming, I knew he would be an excellent resource for helping me reimagine how to express this process visually. He had two thoughts on what he’d do if he were trying to make a graphical model of something like that. His first thought was that he’d look at the conventions that computer program flowchart creators use when they make models to map out what a program should(n’t) be able to do before it gets programmed. He was thinking that they might have some clever organizational and symbolic conventions that might help him communicate the idea to a broader audience as well as help make a tidy graphical design. His second thought was that if he were to do it with only the knowledge he currently possessed that he would organize the research phases horizontally with differently shaped boxes within each phase to graphically represent the empathetic dimensions. When I probed him about whether or not he would be concerned with folks looking at his model and assuming some type of linearity to it, he replied that he viewed the model as a part of the whole paper and would rely on the write-up of the paper that the model is contained in to dispel that assumption for his audience. This got me thinking more about symbology and art. Rather than using the common symbology of written words, I started thinking of how I could use simple geometric shapes to represent both ideas and the relationships between those ideas to tell a story. This is not unlike painting and, as a painter, I knew that a medium like watercolor would be most appropriate for illustrating the relationship that I wanted to describe because the transparency of the medium allows parts of the whole image to be layered as well as bleed into one another to communicate the interdependence and non-linear relationship that the components of the Community-based Empathetic Scholarship Model are comprised of. With these ideas stewing about, I was reminded that for this model to be as accessible as possible that I would need to do research about the different colorblind color pallets that are recommended. After spending some time looking through the pallets recommended across the three major types of colorblindness, I noticed that a large component of making the color design of the model accessible would be for the colors to be not only different in which ones I chose, but also different in their values so that there would be enough of a cue to see the components of the model as different from one another. The resulting model is below. 

### Goals for The Model 
1. Evolve the concept of empathy to model over the general processes of other research programs 
2. Edited volume book with different takes on emapthy that help complicate and build the model

I'm curious to learn more about the proposed power dynamic that emerges from relativistic comparisons. I'm wondering if the claim here is that scholars tend to use a binary reference (e.g. better/worse)? If so, perhaps the presentation will draw this out more clearly.  I really like the notion challenging the A vs. -A typology. What does "empathy" do to solve this conundrum? Does it encourage scholars to reject referential ordering? Or, does it encourage more complex/dynamic referential judgements? What are the potential downsides to avoiding/rejecting referential assessments in engaged research? (I think of scholarship in sociology about how important comparisons are for making sense of and interacting within a social world - e.g Star & Bowker, 1999).

How are you defining empathy in this project? Is it a communicative construct? How does it differ from how our colleagues in psychology and other disciplines define empathy? I really love the power consideration here - how might that dynamic play out during the practice of engaged scholarship? Beyond engaged scholarship, how might you extend your call to action (to practice empathy) to other contexts? Given the moment we are living in, your call for action seems to be more important than ever.

You had excellent thoughts about empathy and power in your prelim response which I believe you will further develop. I am also curious to hear more about how you will conceptualize empathy in quantitative research approaches.
