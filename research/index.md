### Evolution of Interests
I do not tend to focus on having a set career goal that I am working toward when I choose projects to participate in, topics to spend hours digging into, or work I put out for others to consider; however, I do regularly choose to reflect upon the trail of mementos that I have left behind me as I forged ahead<sup>1</sup>.

Currently, my areas of interest, as a PhD candidate in Organizational Communication are:
- Physical and digital infrastructure
- Diversity, equity and inclusion
- Identification
- Expressed organizational values
- and, Empathy

Taking my interests in physical and digital infrastructures, I can see linkages to this from as far back as early childhood while growing up around plumbing and construction as well as having watched as a parent went to school to become a Certified Occupational Therapy Assistant (COTA) in my early teens. Growing up around floor plans; ventilation, electircal, and plumbing blueprints; and spending days off from school around construction sites influenced my early imagination which was expressed through self-made box forts out of waterheater boxes, highly imaginative drawings of floor plans for houses with improbible room themes, and small cities made out of locally forged materials. As I got older, my parent returned to school in their 30s and my days off from school were then spent in anatomy & physiology classes, science labs, and being the live model for practicing splint making and studying musle groups. All this exposed me to how human bodies can function and can adapt with(out) the use of tools. With all of this in my trail of mementos, as I entered college and took classes that taught me about intersectional feminism and communicaiton I got to thinking more about the mementos and how we communicate belonging through (lack of) accessibility in our building layouts. I was also introduced to how websites are (not) accessible by colleagues and public figures with a variety of (dis)abilities (see [Molly Burke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKztFpVJ-XE)). 

Based on how I conceptualize my interests with regard to physical and digital infrastructures, I do not think it will come as a surprise that I am keenly interested in diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations. As a scholar at the, among many, intersections of being white, cisgendered, bisexual, and disabled I am constantly challenging myself to wrestle with recognizing my privileges, reinterpreting my limits on access to power, and unearthing socialized hegemonic narratives engrained in my vantage point. One example of navigating equity in accessing institutional support that routinely return to when I think about this topic comes from my first year of community college. As a first generation college student on any college campus, you are very much at a disadvantage when it comes to getting information about resources and knowing what to expect of the institution as many of your peers, faculty members, and support staff tend to be so used to many of these processes that it might be occurr to them that the explaination they provide begins at Step D rather than Step A. One great boon to being first generation on a community college campus is that this problem is lesser so than at a junior college or university, but it is still present. For myself, I was fortunate that when I foundmyself at my wit's end with trying to get help  that there was a very empathetic and kind person listening to me at the front desk of the Financial Aid office. Hearing my frustrations and confusion lead them to direct me to the TRiO office for advising.

<sup>1</sup> It is critical that _we_ begin to recognize how both the trail of mementos as well as the act of forging ahead are not fully autonomous decisions. Often, our choices are dictated by, as Maslow would convieve of them, base needs like the ability to eat, sleep, and live in a secure shelter. These needs continue to come at a cost under the contemporary socio-political conceptualization of what _life_ looks like. While I value the work that I've done, I do think that it is critical to recognize this major influence on my decision making publically and call on others to do the same.
