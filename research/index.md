### Evolution of Interests
I do not tend to focus on having a set career goal that I am working toward when I choose projects to participate in, topics to spend hours digging into, or work I put out for others to consider; however, I do regularly choose to reflect upon the trail of mementos that I have left behind me as I forged ahead<sup>1</sup>.

Currently, my areas of interest, as a PhD candidate in Organizational Communication are:
- Physical and digital infrastructure
- Diversity, equity and inclusion
- Identification
- Expressed organizational values
- and, Empathy

Taking my interests in physical and digital infrastructures, I can see linkages to this from as far back as early childhood while growing up around plumbing and construction as well as having watched as a parent went to school to become a Certified Occupational Therapy Assistant (COTA) in my early teens. Growing up around floor plans; ventilation, electrical, and plumbing blueprints; and spending days off from school around construction sites influenced my early imagination which was expressed through self-made box forts out of water heater boxes, highly imaginative drawings of floor plans for houses with improbable room themes, and small cities made out of locally forged materials. As I got older, my parent returned to school in their 30s and my days off from school were then spent in anatomy & physiology classes, science labs, and being the live model for practicing splint making and studying muscle groups. All this exposed me to how human bodies can function and can adapt with(out) the use of tools. With all of this in my trail of mementos, as I entered college and took classes that taught me about intersectional feminism and communication I got to thinking more about the mementos and how we communicate belonging through (lack of) accessibility in our building layouts. I was also introduced to how websites are (not) accessible by colleagues and public figures with a variety of (dis)abilities (see [Molly Burke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKztFpVJ-XE)).

As a scholar at the, among many, intersections of being white, cisgendered, bisexual, and disabled I am constantly challenging myself to wrestle with recognizing my privileges, reinterpreting my limits on access to power, and unearthing socialized hegemonic narratives engrained in my vantage point. One example of navigating equity in accessing institutional support that I routinely return to when I think about diversity, equity, and inclusion comes from my first year of community college. As a first generation college student on any college campus, you are very much at a disadvantage when it comes to getting information about resources and knowing what to expect of the institution as many of your peers, faculty members, and support staff tend to be used to many of these processes and it might be occur to them that the explanation they provide begins at Step D rather than Step A. This disparity can be exacerbated by a number of intersectional issues (ex. race, (dis)ability, gender presentation, etc.) and it is the effects/outcomes of the interaction of identity with institutions that I am deeply concerned with both understanding and amending. 

In addition to being interested in how identities are supported/limited by institutions, I am interested in how individuals come to identify with the various institutions they interact with as well as what barriers exist to their being able to identify with a particular organization. Connected with my interests in physical and digital infrastructures, I am particularly interested in the ways that an organization is built could have an impact on how people either do or do not forge an identity as part of the institution. For example, there has been much discussion about gendered bathrooms being an infrastructural barrier to identifying with an organization for folks who identify as non-binary or are/have transitioned. The process of negotiating how to exist comfortably in the space is impacted by the physical infrastructural limit that cis-normative & bi-gendered bathrooms communicate. A similar barrier to organizational identification that exists within digital infrastructures are the ways that information is presented on websites of institutions. It is, as [Bob Regan](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/990657.990663?casa_token=ALg1ZAOTRyQAAAAA:rV_eDuq9JoqgMIHCe0FTpCGzbEX1GdZRe31ANRONS_9-buyvNeBMaNfclNs1C8BWNb4TJC_v40ZiaQ) described in his 2004 ACM conference proceedings "A Failure of the Imagination" that there exists a fissure between web accessibility and web design. Regan's work and the countless labor of (dis)ability activists not only highlight the issue that many institutions will falsely assume they need to sacrifice on web accessibility in order to have a well-designed website, but challenges institutions to commit to doing both. These, and other similar, interactions between individuals and the various institutions that are part of their lives are what embody my interests of identification.

As something that will come to no surprise to folks who work for large organizations, there is commonly a disconnect between the expressed values of the organization and the lived reality of those working for the organization. It is not uncommon for organizations to claim that values like diversity, equity and inclusion _are of critical importance_ to them, but, just below the surface, one can see that there is a lack of supporting action for this claim. This disconnect is often thought of as an act of intentional malice--and I do not doubt this as a factor--but I think that there's more to it than that. Borrowing from a childhood trauma perspective, I think that when those in a position of power and authority make a promise it is not uncommon for it to be a messy way for someone to miscommunicate their hopes. They may want to do what they promise, but they announce that promise before they have the plans for how to make it happen and that haste is often driven by popular discourse. This is not an effort to downplay the pain these actions have caused nor alleviate responsibility for these actions from the powerful decision makers of these organizations, but I believe that in approaching understanding the motivations that can drive this kind of harmful miscommunication I am better able to make suggestions for change that do not put these organizations on the offensive.  

So as to not duplicate my full webpage on [empathy](current_TBR_list) and the modeling of it, I will briefly share that, in the work I’ve done, empathy is about _approaching knowing what another is feeling_, _simulating feeling what another is feeling_, and _communicating compassionately_. I treat empathy as a [metatheoretical approach](methodologies) in my work which means that it shapes the ways that I plan, conduct, and disseminate my work with, by, and for communities. 

In addition to a wealth of personal experiences, my path has been shaped by the research and programs that I've been part of as well as my academic focuses which were guided by interactions with many people. Early on in my academic career, I dreamed of becoming a botanist with specializations in carnivorous plants and mycology. I had planned that my work would lead me to creating my own multi-climate botanical museum and educational center where people could visit and learn about the many fascinating properties of plants as well as learn about the histories of relationships that people have had with these plants. As I progressed through an Associate of Science degree I hit a bit of a snag related to both poor grades in some difficult classes and the lack of financial aid to support me taking these courses again. It was also at this time that I was taking a course in Interpersonal Communication and decided to pivot from a more scientific approach toward a humanities focus. This lead me to completing an Associates of Arts degree with a focus in Communication Studies, sex education, and domestic violence. 

Upon transferring to my Bachelor’s institution, I was introduced to the disciplines of Women’s Studies and Comparative Ethic Studies which drew me in with promise that I’d get to drill down deeper into the noise that takes place in communication. With those areas of focus, I chose to also pursue a focus in archaeology. The completion of my Bachelor’s in Arts was built upon my interests in Chicana, Black and Intersectional feminisms; addiction recovery; domestic violence; mental health; and personal storytelling as a way of knowing. 

With having been heavily steeped in theories, I left my undergraduate education both wanting to avoid my student loans and wanting to learn how to _do something_ with all the angst and theoretical knowledge I had gained in the last four and a half years. This lead me to pursue a Master of Arts in Applied Anthropology. I initially set out to study archaeology and build on the ideas I was forming about how to create comparative modeling for contemporary and historic violence, but I was strongly encouraged to instead work in socio-cultural and medical anthropology as well as folklore studies. This produced specializations in public health work, community organizing, identity, and folklore/storytelling. 

Still in pursuit of my interest in modeling violence at different levels across time, I am now returning to Communication Studies and find myself within Organizational Communication focusing on infrastructure and physical/digital landscapes; identity; DEI; belonging; expressed organizational values, empathy, and much more!


<sup>1</sup> It is critical that _we_ begin to recognize how both the trail of mementos as well as the act of forging ahead are not fully autonomous decisions. Often, our choices are dictated by, as Maslow would convieve of them, base needs like the ability to eat, sleep, and live in a secure shelter. These needs continue to come at a cost under the contemporary socio-political conceptualization of what _life_ looks like. While I value the work that I've done, I do think that it is critical to recognize this major influence on my decision making publically and call on others to do the same.
