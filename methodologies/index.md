## Methodologies & Data Management

There are a bunch of methods that I have used and several that I'd like to use at some point. 

### Methods I Have Used

Focus Groups (standard and modified)
Oral History Interviewing
One-on-one Interviewing
Storytelling & Narrative Analysis
Inductive Thematic Analysis 
Survey Development and Analysis
Lite Descriptive Statistics

### Methods I Would Like to Try

Storytelling Groups
Pile Sorting
Network Analysis

### Data Management

I've done secondary data and archival data management for projects where I was working to try to blend qualitative and quantitative data into a usable database. Be sure to keep an eye out in the LASER PULSE July newsletter for my blog post about my approach to data management!
