## Organizational Relationships
### [Anti-Racist Reading Group](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~bradfoa/antiracist_reading_group/)
_"In a racist society it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist." --Angela Davis_

This is a reading group in the Purdue math department that I co-facilitate with Alden Bradford. The group is focused on antiracism, generally in the world at large and specifically in the realms of math and math education. We strive to maintain an inclusive atmosphere for open discussion, personal growth, and active exploration. Total beginners to antiracism are especially welcome, and you don't have to complete every reading every week to participate.

Check out the readings that our group have completed and anticipate reading as we continue to meet on the [Antiracist Reading List](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~bradfoa/antiracist_reading_group/reading_list/)!

### Writer's Workshop Group

This is a group of graduate students in the Brian Lamb School of Communication that get together twice a week via Zoom to talk about our writing processes, share our tips for keeping track of those sneaky conference deadlines, and serve as a social obligation which reminds us to keep up with our writing. I founded this group during the Fall Semester of 2020 as a response to the overwhelming isolation of doing academic work that was being exacerbated by the global pandemic of COVID-19. 

We are open to graduate students from all disciplines! Why struggle alone when it's more cathartic to struggle together? Spring Semester 2022 we will be meeting on Mondays and Wednesdays.

Here's a list of some of the helpful resources that members have shared that have helped them as they work on improving their relationship to the work of writing and the writing process:
