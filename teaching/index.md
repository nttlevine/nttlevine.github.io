## Teaching
### Current Assignment

Naomi will not be teaching for Spring semester 2022 as she will be on research leave

### Previous Teaching Assignments

_COM114: Introduction to Presentational Speaking_

This is a general education requirement for all undergraduate students attending Purdue University. A personal emphasis I have when teaching this course is on delivery. As someone with a background in theatrical performance, professional public speaking, and competitive Speech & Debate, I have experienced the distinction between simply giving a monologue/speech and _delivering_ those same lines/ideas with flourish.

Book Used:

_COM102: Introduction to Communicaiton Theory_

This course is one of three required courses for the Communication Studies major in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue University. A strong emphasis of this course is practicing applying theory. This emphasis is what brigns me back to instructing and being a teaching assistant for this course as often as my schedule permits.  

Book Used: A First Look at Communication Theory (10th edition) by Em Griffin, Andrew Ledbetter & Glenn Sparks (McGraw-Hill, 2018).

In this [Example of Naomi teaching COM102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmPC6XiiUyQ) from Maymester 2021, you will hear her discussing Muted Group Theory. This video lecture exists as part of a series of lectures delivered asychronously to students taking this course for credit. 

_COM204: Critical Perspectives in Communication_

This course is one of three required courses for the Communication Studies major in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue University. 

Book Used: None; this course relies on lectures and supplemental materials

_COM324: Introduction to Organizational Communication_

Communication is a process through which we build social realities and engage with those around us, and it plays an essential role in organizations, both at the individual and systems level. Communication is integral to how we choose to organize, how a business operates, and how we  study both.  In addition to answering questions like, “What is an organization?” and “What is organizational communication?” this class will examine: (1) approaches to organizing; (2) perspectives on and critiques of organizations; as well as (3) special topics in organizational communication. In all of these areas, we will discuss, reflect on, and evaluate current research, theory, and practice in organizational communication. And as organizational communication is inherent in everyday life, this course will also provide you with the opportunity to apply course material to your experience beyond the classroom.
