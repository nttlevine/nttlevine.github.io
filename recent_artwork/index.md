## Artwork by Naomi
I am a self-taught mixed media artist. I commonly work with recycled and repurposed materials as a means to improve my impact on the environment, save money, and transform materials that are commonly overlooked. I most commonly work with watercolor, gouache, acrylic paints, and acrylic inks. Some of my favorite art tools are fixed and modified vintage toys like the [Twirl-o-Paint](https://www.industrialartifacts.net/products/vintage-twirl-o-paint-childrens-painting-turntable?variant=13256531771435) and [The Big Press](https://media.hibid.com/img.axd?id=4392046215&wid=&p=&ext=&w=0&h=0&t=&lp=&c=True&wt=False&sz=Max&rt=0&checksum=ZyLkULNan0e4jF917H84vMtV0qjFPo2A). In addition to different techniques for painting and the use of vintage art toys, I also liek to create film projects professionally and personally.

At least once per semester, from February 2019 through November 2021, I hosted Paint Nights for the Purdue Graduate Student Government. This event was routinely fully booked with a long waitlist as it had been incredibly popular. 

### Taking Off My Eyeballs
![glasses](glasses.png)

_This multimedia art piece was created using acrylic paint on a pair of out of glasses that had an out of date presecription using the reverse painting technique._

_This work was an opportunity for me to transform a pair of glasses that I had in lingering around with me which did not have a use to me as the prescription was out-of-date. I also felt compelled to take up the reverse painting technique with this project to practice thinking of my paintings in terms of layering like one might do in digital art. I had been dabbling a bit in digital art around the time I made these and thought to use the digital platform as a way to plan out each of the painted layers. It was fun to see how considering the end goal of painting influenced my practicing with digital art and how the digital tools served as assistive technology for me in this project. As a child I was always fascinated with tiny objects and beads were no exception to this so I made the glasses chain out of my collection of acquired and found beads that I've carried around with me for years. The final presentation of this project was a return to the digital art that I was practicing and using to assist me in creating these glasses. I was pleased that I was able to use technology to both recreate eyes and remove eyes from this work._

### Twirl-o-Painting 45s
![45s](twirl_paint.jpg)

_This was my set up at Art in the Park, hosted by the Lafayette Parks Department, in the summer of 2020._

_This is an example of my use of a piece of retro children’s art equipment for creating my own work. After some modification, The Twirl-o-Paint is able to hold 45rpm records and I’m able to cover the labels on the records to preserve them. Sometimes I will draw color inspiration from the label itself and others from the title of the song. All 45s used for this work were purchased in a large lot of damaged and no longer functional 45s from eBay. At about $0.10 per 45, this is an inexpensive surface to work with and gives me flexibility to work with a variety of medium to high flow acrylic paints. For me, this is like the fun of tie-dye, but faster. One of my favorite parts about my time as a vendor for Art in the Park was all the young kids dragging older relatives over to my table to show them to cool colors and the Twirl-o-Paint then followed by the older relatives trying to explain to the children what a 45 record was._ 

### Zoom wedding
![zoom wedding art work](zoom_wedding.jpg)

_This multimedia art work was created over the course of several years. The final product was realized during the COVID-19 spring of 2021._

_This work demonstrates a core concept that I teach as a Recreational Art Instructor; no canvas is truly wasted on "bad" art because we can simply paint over it until we like what we see. I began working with this specific canvas in 2019 and it has featured numerous art pieces on it that I have displayed in my own home, but those pieces never stayed for very long because they just did not fee quite right to me. It was in the fall of 2020 that I felt compelled to make my most drastic revision to this canvas yet by cutting slits onto it and embroidering new elements to its surface. Over the months that I continued to build on this latest version the additions to the piece became more complicated and I was uncertain that, like the COVID-19 pandemic, this project would ever come to an end. Fortunately, and unlike the pandemic (as of January 2022), this project came to a place where it felt comfortably completed in the spring of 2021._

### Spirit Houses in Eklutna, AK
![spirit houses](spirit_houses.jpg)

_This watercolor sketch was created in the summer of 2021 on a trip I took to Alaska._

_This work was created as a means to recapture a memory of a moment that I had photographed while visiting some of the Spirit Houses in Eklutna, Alaska, in the summer of 2021. The colonialist and proselytizing push that catalyzed a blending different burial traditions together fascinated me. As an outsider to both communities I felt odd taking in this site and humbled by the stubbornness of both communities to continue both of their practices rather than having one completely eclipse the other. I like to recapture small moments of my travel that I capture in photographs as it allows me to spend more time with that moment than I might have had initially._

### Videos

[Technofeminism](https://youtu.be/VaXiNDdpK90) _is a video essay that I created for an independent study course I did in the summer of 2020. This was my first attempt at a video essay and I am most proud of the short sci-fi sketch my husband performed in to highlight what Technofeminism is not._

[Even the Toothbrush Was Digital](https://youtu.be/UEXgznoUKl4) _is the second video essay that I created and was for a course I took in the fall of 2020. The goal of this project was to explore my relationship to technology during my time working-from-home because of COVID-19 and reflecting on the intersectionality of technological and work experiences._

[Rotary Number Pad Infomercial](https://youtu.be/16BeWr7bywQ) _is a fake advertisement I created for Alden Bradford's electronics project where he transformed a rotary phone into a number pad for computers. Is it a practical item? Will this be the next technological sensation? Does this feel a little adjacent to Steam Punk technologies? I'll let you decide._
