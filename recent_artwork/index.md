### Zoom wedding

_This multimedia art work was created over the course of several years. The final product was realized during the COVID-19 spring of 2021._
_This work demonstrates a core concept that I teach as a Recreational Art Instructor; no canvas is truly wasted on "bad" art because we can simply paint over it until we like what we see._
